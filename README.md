multiple_battery_status
=======================

Simple python script to display the current battery usage in percent when 
running multiple batteries in Ubuntu

I wrote this because I just wanted to know what percentage of battery I have
left, and ubuntu doesn't tell me this.

REQUIREMENTS
============

* Python
* ACPI


Tested on Ubuntu 12.04


INSTALLATION
============

Download or clone the repo


RUNNING
=======

make sure the battery script is executable:

`$ chmod +x battery.py`
 
 
Run the script:

`$ ./battery.py`

Battery capacity: 46.39%
